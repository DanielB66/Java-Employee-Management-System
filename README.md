# Java Employee Management System

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an employee management system using Java. It includes various classes to handle different types of employees and their details, demonstrating object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and design patterns in Java.

## Features
- Manage different types of employees (permanent and temporary).
- Implement functionalities for employee management within a factory.
- Use of polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation to create a flexible and scalable system.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- **Java:** The primary programming language used for the employee management system.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DanielB66/Java-Employee-Management-System
   ```
2. Compile the Java files.
   ```sh
   javac *.java
   ```
3. Run the `Factory.java` script to see the application in action.
   ```sh
   java Factory
   ```

## Classes
- **Employee.java:** Represents a generic employee.
- **Factory.java:** Manages the factory and contains methods to add and manage employees.
- **PermanentEmployee.java:** Extends Employee to add features specific to permanent employees.
- **TemporaryEmployee.java:** Extends Employee to add features specific to temporary employees.
- **Point.java:** Utility class for geometric computations.
- **Triangle.java:** Represents a geometric triangle, demonstrating the use of Point.

## Object-Oriented Principles Demonstrated
- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulating data within classes and providing public methods to interact with that data.
- **Inheritance:** Creating a hierarchy of classes that inherit properties and methods from base classes.
- **Polymorphism:** Using method overriding and interfaces to allow objects to be treated as instances of their parent class or interface.
- **Abstraction:** Defining abstract classes and methods to provide a template for derived classes.
